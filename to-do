#Progress and shit

Pre Jan. 29th - Got the whole login mechanism for the captains working! Wooooo!!

Jan. 30th - Started working on User registration. Maybe have a register button right on the login
            page and when you click it it leads to another URL where you register and stuff

Feb. 6th - I'm not having a register button, there's no point. Instead I will manually register
            everyone. Now I need to work on changing up the base. Now I'm on the challenging part
            on how do I register everyone and there members and how do I make it all individualized for
            everyone.
